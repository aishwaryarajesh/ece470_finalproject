# ece470_finalproject

Hi!

We are using this website so we collaborate on the code, but we have most of the files done locally. The simulator we are using is CoppeliaSim, and we are using Python (in Spyder) to program the UR3 robot. 

Project 1:

For this update, most of what did is in the file main.py. Basically, the script is divided into 3 parts.

The first one is establishing the connection between CoppeliaSim and Python (line 8-14)
The second is initializing/defining all the robots joints and the sensor we attached to it (line 16-23)
The third one is a while loop (line 26-49)containg the actions the robot does. We programmed to move to a default position, check its proximity sensor, then move somehwere close to the "grill", and check its proximity sensor again. 
There is some code that is commented out that we were not able to finish yet, but we are working on it.
